CompressAI (_compress-ay_) is a PyTorch library and evaluation platform for
end-to-end compression research.

CompressAI currently provides:

* custom operations, layers and models for deep learning based data compression
* a partial port of the official [TensorFlow compression
  ](https://github.com/tensorflow/compression) library
* pre-trained end-to-end compression models for learned image compression
* evaluation scripts to compare learned models against classical image/video
  compression codecs

## Installation

CompressAI only supports python 3.6+ and PyTorch 1.4+. A C++17 compiler, a
recent version of pip (19.0+), and common python packages (see `setup.py` for
the full list) are also required.

To get started and install CompressAI, run the following commands in a [virtual
environment](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/venv.html):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI compressai
cd compressai
pip install -U pip && pip install -e .
pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16
pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.17
（python==3.6）
```

For a custom installation, you can also run one of the following commands:
* `pip install -e '.[dev]'`: install the packages required for development (testing, linting, docs)
* `pip install -e '.[tutorials]'`: install the packages required for the tutorials (notebooks)
* `pip install -e '.[all]'`: install all the optional packages

This is the currently recommended installation method. Docker images and PyPI
packages will be released in the future. Conda environments are not officially
supported.

* [CompressAI API](https://interdigitalinc.github.io/CompressAI/)

## Usage

### Examples

Script and notebook examples can be found in the `examples/` directory.

To encode/decode images with the provided pre-trained models, run the
`codec.py` example:

```bash
python3 examples/codec.py --help
```

An examplary training script with a rate-distortion loss is provided in
`examples/train.py`. You can replace the model used in the training script
with your own model implemented within CompressAI, and then run the script for a
simple training pipeline:

```bash
python3 examples/train.py -d /path/to/my/image/dataset/ --epochs 300 -lr 1e-4 --batch-size 16 --cuda --save
```
> **Note:** the training example uses a custom [ImageFolder](https://interdigitalinc.github.io/CompressAI/datasets.html#imagefolder) structure.

A jupyter notebook illustrating the usage of a pre-trained model for learned image
compression is also provided in the `examples` directory:

```bash
pip install -U ipython jupyter ipywidgets matplotlib
jupyter notebook examples/
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate a pre-trained model on your own dataset, CompressAI provides an
evaluation script:

```bash
python3 -m compressai.utils.eval_model MODEL_NAME /path/to/images/folder/
```

To evaluate published classical or machine-learning based image/video
codec solutions:

```bash
python3 -m compressai.utils.bench --help
python3 -m compressai.utils.bench bpg --help
python3 -m compressai.utils.bench vtm --help
```
